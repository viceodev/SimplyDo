# SimplyDo
My First React App

In my quest to switch from a LAMP Stack Developer to a MERN Stack Developer, i built this as my first project using React.

SimplyDo is a simple task tracker where you can add task you need to work on and also check them as completed. Also you can delete tasks as you move through them.

Building this project, I learned 

1. React App Structure.
2. State Management.
3. Using Hooks in React.
4. Working with Tailwind css.
